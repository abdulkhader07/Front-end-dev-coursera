As a developer, you'll use many CSS libraries and frameworks throughout your career.
As you move on to different projects and as technologies advance, knowing what
solutions are available is critical. While Bootstrap is one of the most popular
CSS libraries, many others are available, each with different purposes, designs
and technical approaches. This reading will introduce you to other popular CSS 
libraries and frameworks.

Beside bootstrap we have many libraries 
1.)Foundation
Foundation is a framework for building user interfaces similar to Bootstrap.
It is used by many large companies such as Pixar, Polar and Sonos. One prominent
feature of Foundation is that it can be used to style content for sending via email.

2.)pure.css
Pure.css is another library for building user interfaces. While it doesn't have
as many features as Bootstrap, it is designed to be minimal in file size. Smaller
file sizes improve loading times for web pages as there is less data to transfer 
from the web server. If your next project is focused on minimal loading time, this
library is worth considering.

3.) Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that uses a utility-based approach for its CSS 
rules. This means that the framework provides many CSS classes with a single purpose.
For example, the CSS class pt-6 sets the padding-top CSS property to 6 pixels. This
 means that you can be precise in applying styling to your HTML without writing CSS.
The advantage to this is that it is more flexible for customizing your webpage's
design using the framework. However, the disadvantage is that if multiple developers
are working on a project, it could lead to inconsistent design if the team is not 
strict on its design rules.

UIKit is a lightweight CSS framework featuring a small set of responsive components.
Its simple design allows developers to easily customize the style rules and visuals.

5.) MVP.css
MVP.css is a small CSS library that automatically styles HTML elements without
needing to apply CSS classes to them. The library aims to allow a developer to 
quickly prototype a user interface without worrying about the final design, while 
still being visually appealing. MVP comes from the technical term Minimal Viable 
Product, a product with sufficient features to demo to customers or other 
business stakeholders.
